# Feature Libraries

## `JMAP`

[JSON Meta Application Protocol](https://jmap.io) (JMAP)) is a modern, API-based approach to email that uses standard HTTP requests and responses with JSON serialization for transit.

`JMAP` feature library is a _client_ implementation of both [JMAP core](https://jmap.io/spec-core.html) and [JMAP mail](https://jmap.io/spec-mail.html) protocols, with functionality tailored for use in [Thunderbird for iOS.](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-ios)
